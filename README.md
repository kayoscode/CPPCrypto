System uses both a software and hardware version of AES and the software version is absolutely vulnerable to a cache timing attack so if put on a server, be sure your system supports AES-NI which should be a little more secure. For most purposes, this cryptography suite will be secure enough, but again, for professional projects, use professional software.
